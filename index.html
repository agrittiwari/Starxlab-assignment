           <p>1) Get number of hours, minutes and seconds from number of seconds.
            For example :  If number of seconds provided are 129 , then number of hours will be 0 , minutes 2, seconds 9.
            Input :  Number of seconds.
            Output : “Hours = ‘number of hours’, minutes = ‘number of minutes’ , seconds = ‘number of seconds’ ”
            </p><p>
            2) You are given  two numbers L and R, you have to find if XOR of all the numbers in range L to R (L,R both inclusive) is odd or even.
            Input:
            The first line will contain T, number of testcases.
            Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers L,R.
            
            Output:
            For each testcase, in the new line print "Odd" if the XOR in the range is odd, else print "Even".
            Sample Input:
              4
              1 4
              2 6
              3 3
              2 3
            
            Sample Output:
              Even
              Even
              Odd
              Odd
              </p><p>
                  
            
            3) You are given with T number of strings. You need to sort the strings according to their first character.
            Input :
            4
            “AXXX”
            “UVVVV”
            “PGGGG”
            “BOOUU”
            
            Output :
            “AXXX”
            “BOOUU”
            “PGGGG”
            “UVVVV”
